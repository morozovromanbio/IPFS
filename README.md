# Homework
* Read the references
* Experiment with IPFS with other files and folders
# Weekend project
* Build a web server and API for providing the features using the RESTful architecture
* Run a local node of IPFS
* Upload 10 images to this node
* Create a JSON and build metadata descriptions for 10 NFTs, each using one unique image
* Make a GET method in the API to get the metadata by id
* Deploy a NFT Collection and mint 10 NFTs, and assign the API endpoint to the token URI
* Integrate this NFT Collection contract and APIs in a frontend application to display NFTs metadata and images
* (Bonus) provide wallet functions in the frontend to buy, transfer, allow, transfer from and burn NFTs
